# EclipseOS

This was made following the [bare bones osdev guide](https://wiki.osdev.org/Bare_Bones) and modified to my liking

## Requirements
___

- you will need [zig](https://ziglang.org/) to compile this project using the `build.zig` file provided.  you may also use the [GCC Cross-Compiler](https://wiki.osdev.org/GCC_Cross-Compiler) if you so wish.  however the way provided may seem easier.

- to build the iso, you will need grub tools.

- to emulate this OS, you may use whatever VM you wish.  just make sure it supports legacy, and runs as x86.
